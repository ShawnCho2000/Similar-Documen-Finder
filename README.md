This code is very simple to run! All of the file titles are provided in the BigTitleTest.csv file, and this file name
is hard coded into mainLSH.py on line 10.
To start, open terminal and enter "python3 mainLSH.py" to start the code.
After the welcome message, you will be prompted to enter keywords of papers or specific title names from the dataset.
Feel free to copy and paste from the original file, or search separate words like "decision tree", "neural network", 
or even "Baye's theorem".
The results that are outputted will be the closest matches! If no matches are found, try a couple more times for the
randomness to run thoroughly.
Have fun! Thank you for a great quarter.
